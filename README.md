# Diabetes prediction with imbalanced data

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pre-processing on the BRFSS2021 healthcare dataset, including handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- Applied and compared various imbalanced data handling techniques (oversampling, undersampling, and combination).
- Trained and fine-tuned machine learning models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, HistGradientBoosting, kNN) for diabetes prediction.
- Evaluated model performance using ROC AUC, Average Precision, Recall, Precision, and F1-score.
- Identified HistGradientBoosting model with SMOTEENN technique as the best performing approach.
